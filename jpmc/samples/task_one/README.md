## Task 1: Interface With a Stock Price Data Feed

In this exercise, JPMorgan Chase & Co. demonstrated how software engineers play a critical role in
facilitating the success of their traders by teaching me how to interface with a stock price data
feed and establish an advanced analytical system for comprehensive data analysis, which included the
development of sophisticated dashboards tailored to optimize the identification of both over and
undervalued stocks.

Additionally, I gained comprehension of the intricacies inherent in the structure and components of
an engineering ticket within this specialized context.
