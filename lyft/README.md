## My Virtual Experience With Lyft

During this virtual experience provided by Forage and sponsored by Lyft, I learned how to:

- produced a clean design for a messy component of a software architecture using Python and UML
- refactored the software architecture using the "Factory Method" and "Strategy" patterns
- wrote various unit tests for the architecture's newly refactored system using Python
- added new functionality to the architecture's system using the TDD (Test-Driven Development)
  methodology

## A Unified Modeling Language (UML) Exemplary Diagram

This unified modeling language (UML) diagram showcases my attempted redesign of the project's
software architecture.
